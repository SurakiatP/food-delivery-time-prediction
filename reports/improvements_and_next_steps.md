# âœ¨ Improvements and Next Steps

## ðŸš€ Potential Improvements

- **Hyperparameter Optimization**
  - Use advanced tuning methods like `Optuna` or `Bayesian Optimization` for deeper exploration beyond grid search.

- **Model Explainability**
  - Add SHAP or LIME to explain feature impact and improve interpretability.

- **Additional Features**
  - Incorporate external data such as:
    - Weather conditions
    - Traffic density
    - Time of day or weekday/weekend

- **Handle Outliers**
  - Use IQR or z-score methods to reduce noise in delivery time targets.

- **Imbalanced Feature Engineering**
  - Analyze distribution of categorical variables and apply frequency encoding or target encoding if needed.

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps

- **Deployment**
  - Convert the pipeline into a RESTful API using `FastAPI` or a web app via `Streamlit`.

- **Monitoring**
  - Set up model performance tracking with tools like `MLflow` or `Weights & Biases`.

- **Retraining Pipeline**
  - Automate retraining as more delivery data becomes available.

- **Real-World Testing**
  - Collect real-time delivery data to compare model performance in production.
